Place the logo image(s) you uploaded into this `assets/` folder.

Filename to use in the credits modal:
- `assets/vexel.png`

If your uploaded image has a different name, either rename it to `vexel.png` or update the `src` in `index.html` (<img id="creditsLogo">).

Tip: Use a transparent PNG sized around 600–1200px width for best results.
